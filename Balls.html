    <h3>Jewish behavior matches the Gospel. Everything they show to the public is just that, a show.
        Every jew that spoke publicly was reading from a script. "Antisemitism" & "Holocaust" are just common
        words, but jews who spoke in public read the same script after october 7th
        They ALL LIED about 40 dead babies? Well now they act like they didn't lie, as if it was PART OF HISTORY.
        That should tell you something about these people.

        The hypocrisy knows no bounds,
    </h3>

    <h1>Oh How they love that word antisemitism and Holocaust. While they promote white guilt in public</h1>
    <img src="IsraelSite/FellowWhites.jpg">
    <h1 class="bibleVerse">They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people’s shoulders, 
        but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. Matthew 23:4</h1>
    <br>
    <h1> in some sects of judiasm you can not flip a light switch or drive a car because it is considered "work".
        It is laweful for a gentile dog to do that for you. These same religious leaders accused Jesus Christ of healong on the sabbath.
        As if was a crime.
    </h1>
    <h4 >My athiestic/apostate view's taught by my leader can not process this.</h3>

    <h1>The People at the time asked yes/no gotcha questions, "Do we pay taxes to Ceaser, YES/NO?</h1>
    <br>
    <h1>You can not appease a Mob:</h1>
    <h2 class="bibleVerse">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another: ‘We played the 
        flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’ 33For John the Baptist 
        came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’ 34The Son of Man came eating 
        and drinking, and you say, 
        ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’></h2>

        <h2>John THe Baptist doesnt drink enough</h2>
        <h2>But this guys is a on glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</h2>
        <h2>He does too much</h2>
        <h2>He doesn't too enough</h2>
        <h2>Nothing is every perfect so they can maintain control over that person</h2>
